RefMonitor
==========

This is a reference monitor for file operations and it is built in Restricted python.

<Restricted Python is a sandbox environment where the trusted computing base has been reduced to minimum>

This code serves as a security layer on a file which checks the permissions of a user about to perform any operation on the file and allow/disallow it accordingly.
